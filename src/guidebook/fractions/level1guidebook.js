                    Addition is important for learning mathematics! Start by
                    starting from the number on the left, and moving forward the
                    number on the right.

                        <p>A fraction (from Latin: fractus, "broken") represents a part of a whole or, more generally, any number of equal parts. When spoken in everyday English, a fraction describes how many parts of a certain size there are, for example, one-half, eight-fifths, three-quarters.</p>
