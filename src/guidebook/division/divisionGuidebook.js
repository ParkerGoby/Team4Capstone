                                <p>Division (usually signified by the plus symbol รท) is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, the other three being 
                                addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Division is important for learning mathematics! We 
                                start with the number of stars on the left, and make groups with the number on the right. Then, we count
                                how many groups we have. In this case, we start with 6 stars and make groups of 3 stars, leaving us with 2 groups.
                                This can be written as 6 รท 3 = 2.</p>
