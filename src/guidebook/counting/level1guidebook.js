                    Addition is important for learning mathematics! Start by
                    starting from the number on the left, and moving forward the
                    number on the right.

                        <p>Counting is the process of determining the number of elements of a finite set of objects, i.e., determining the size of a set. Counting is extremely important and something that is used everyday. It may seem hard right now, but it is required for learning advanced topics such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and fractions</p>
                        <p>The below video provides a create example for learning how to count:</p>
